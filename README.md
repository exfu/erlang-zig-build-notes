## Why Zig?

Think of Zig as the new kid on the block in the programming world – it's designed to be simple, efficient, and give you a lot of control. We're betting that its modern approach to building software can bring some fresh air to the Erlang/OTP build process. Plus, it's just plain fun to try new things!

## Why Do We Need a New Build System?

The current way Erlang/OTP builds itself has been around for a while. While it's robust, it can also be a bit complex and rely on tools that might feel a bit dated. We're hoping a Zig-based build can offer:

* **Cleaner Code:** A build system written in Zig could be easier to read and understand.
* **Potentially Faster Builds:** Zig is known for its speed, so maybe we can shave some time off those build times.
* **More Control:** Zig gives us fine-grained control over the build process.
* **Learning Opportunity:** It's a fantastic way to dive deep into both Erlang/OTP and Zig.

## How It Compares with Just `configure-makefile`:

The traditional Erlang/OTP build uses `configure` scripts (often generated by Autotools) and Makefiles. This system is powerful but can be hard to debug and extend. Our Zig approach aims to replace this entire chain with a single `build.zig` file, making the build logic more explicit and hopefully easier to manage. Think of it as moving from a complex set of interconnected machines to a single, well-designed tool.

## How It Compares with `kerl`:

`kerl` is a fantastic tool for easily downloading and building Erlang/OTP from source. It still relies on the standard `configure-makefile` system under the hood. Our project aims to go a step further by replacing that underlying build system entirely with Zig. So, while `kerl` manages the standard build process, we're trying to create a whole new way to build Erlang.

## How It Compares with `asdf/mise`:

`asdf` and `mise` are version managers that allow you to easily switch between different versions of programming languages and tools, including Erlang. They typically rely on the standard build process (often using `kerl` or similar). Our project is focused on changing *how* Erlang is built, not just managing its versions. So, in the future, you might even use `asdf` or `mise` to manage versions built with our Zig system!

# Our Epic Quest: Building Erlang/OTP with Zig

Our goal is simple (in theory!): compile the whole Erlang/OTP shebang using only Zig as the build system. No C compiler needed (fingers crossed!), no more wrestling with Makefiles. Just pure, unadulterated Zig goodness. We're starting with Linux as our test ground.


**The Challenges (It Won't Be Easy!):**

* Erlang/OTP has a *lot* of C code.
* The current build system is super complex.
* We need to figure out how to compile Erlang code without a pre-built Erlang (initially).
* Erlang relies on other external software.
